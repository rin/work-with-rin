      Hello, fellow human.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Rin. I enjoy coding and building things, and 
      I like to use it to contribute to a better world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two years, I've worked fully remotely with a team 
      distributed over at least five countries. Itâ€™s how I do my best work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Got something I'd wanna check out? E-mail me at <mark>{email}</mark>.
